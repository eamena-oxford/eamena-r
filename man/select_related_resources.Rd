\usage{
select_related_resources(
  db.con = NA,
  df = NA,
  having = "Stable",
  measure = "Measurement Number",
  disconn = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{db.con}{a `dbConnect` connection to the database.}

\item{df}{a dataframe resultion from the `list_related_resources()` function, having the UUID of Connected Component}

\item{having}{a vector of values to only keep rr having these values. By default c("Stable"). These values must appear in the `ids.csv` file with their `valueid` (see `python manage.py whatisthis`).}

\item{measure}{the name of the field where the value of `having` is recorded. By default "Measurement Number".}

\item{disconn}{if TRUE (by defalut), will disconnect from the DB.}

\item{verbose}{if TRUE (by default), print messages.}
}
\value{
A dataframe recordind the IDs and UUIDs of the Heritage Place and related resources with, for the latter, the selected fields
}
\description{
For a given Heritage Place, find all related resources (ex: a Built Component) having a a given value (ex: "Stable") in a certain field (ex: "Measurement Number"). This function is run after `list_related_resources()`.
